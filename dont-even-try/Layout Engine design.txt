New design based on the way MFC does the same task:

All windows that support split panel views are defined as a subclass of CPanelContainer.

A split window handles the layout of sub windows, called panels. Each panel must inherit
from CWindow. This means a panel container can be a panel as well, and standard windows can
be managed by panel containers.

Each panel added to a container results in the panel container creating a separator between that 
panel and its neighbors. Separators are small windows (scrollbars?) that can be clicked and dragged
perpendicular to their longest dimension only. 

Panels can only be added sequentially along one axis - either the vertical or horizontal axis.
To get a panel container to do both, you need a special panel container that can handle dropping 
windows into it (think Visual Studio solution explorer). 

A panel container cannot be a main window. A main window may contain a panel container, but the 
panel container cannot directly be used.

For MFC reference, look at winsplit.cpp in $(MSVC2015)\VC\atlmfc\src\mfc or $(MSVC2017)\VC\Tools\MSVC\$(Version)\atlmfc\src\mfc
MFC must be installed for the source files to appear.

HOLY SHIT I JUST REALIZED
